## Project Title
**Student Task Management System**


## Project Overview
The Student Task Management System is a simple console-based application designed to help students organize and track their daily academic tasks.



## Problem Statement
Many students struggle with managing academic tasks such as assignments, projects, and personal study goals. This project provides a simple solution to manage tasks efficiently using a basic software system.



## Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

### Requirement Analysis
The system must:
- Allow users to add tasks
- Display all tasks
- Mark tasks as completed
- Run in a simple console environment



### System Design
The system is designed as a menu-driven Python program.
- Tasks are stored in a list
- Each task has:
  - Task name
  - Completion status


### Implementation
The system is implemented using Python.
Key functions include:
- `add_task()`
- `view_tasks()`
- `complete_task()`
- `main()`

All function names used in the design match the implementation exactly.



### Testing
The system was tested by:
- Adding multiple tasks
- Viewing task lists
- Marking tasks as completed
- Handling invalid inputs



### Deployment
The application runs locally using the Python interpreter and does not require additional dependencies.



### Maintenance
The system can be extended in future to include:
- File storage
- User authentication
- Graphical user interface (GUI)
