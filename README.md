## Project Title
**Student Task Management System**


## Project Overview
The Student Task Management System is a GUI-based application designed to help students manage academic tasks efficiently. The system allows users to add tasks, view them, and mark tasks as completed using an intuitive graphical interface.



## Problem Statement
Students often find it difficult to track multiple academic tasks and deadlines. This project provides a simple and interactive software solution that helps students organize their tasks digitally.



## Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

### Requirement Analysis
The system must:
- Allow students to add new tasks
- Display all tasks clearly
- Mark tasks as completed
- Provide a user-friendly GUI
- Use consistent naming between design and implementation



### System Design
- The system is designed using Python’s Tkinter library
- Tasks are stored in a list of dictionaries
- Each task contains:
  - Task description
  - Completion status
- Blue-themed buttons with soft hover animations are used for better user experience



### Implementation
The system is implemented in Python using Tkinter.
Key functions include:
- `add_task()` – Adds a new task
- `complete_task()` – Marks a task as completed


All function names used in the design phase are maintained exactly in the implementation.



### Testing
The system was tested by:
- Adding multiple tasks
- Completing selected tasks
- Handling empty input and invalid selections
- Verifying GUI responsiveness



### Deployment
The application runs locally on any system with Python installed. No external libraries are required.



### Maintenance
Future improvements may include:
- Saving tasks to a file
- Adding deadlines and priorities
- Enhancing UI animations
- Multi-user support
